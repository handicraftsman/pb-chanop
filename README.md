# pb-chanop

This is a chanop plugin for PositronBot.

## Configuration

Add this to your config file:

```ini
[plugin/chanop]

[group/chanop]
chanop = kick
chanop = remove
chanop = kban
chanop = rban
chanop = ban
chanop = quiet
chanop = op
chanop = hop
chanop = voice
```

Now you can give others the chanop group to allow them using chanop commands.
